small utils for travis:
 - print colored banners
 - wrap commands into run/success/error banners, with automatic retry
 - resolve the branch to test, based on the travis environment variables

----

automated tests, Travis Matrix, Documentation, Badges, etc. are managed with `PizzaCutter <https://github
.com/bitranox/PizzaCutter>`_ (cookiecutter on steroids)

Python version required: 3.6.0 or newer

tested on linux "bionic" with python 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.8-dev, pypy3

`100% code coverage <https://codecov.io/gh/bitranox/lib_travis>`_, codestyle checking ,mypy static type checking ,tested under `Linux, macOS <https://travis-ci.org/bitranox/lib_travis>`_, automatic daily builds and monitoring

Try it Online
-------------

You might try it right away in Jupyter Notebook by using the "launch binder" badge, or click `here <https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/{{rst_include.
repository_slug}}/master?filepath=lib_travis.ipynb>`_

Usage
-----------

usage commandline:


- run a command passed as string

.. code-block:: bash

    # to be used in travis.yml
    # run a command passed as string, wrap it in colored banners, retry 3 times, sleep 30 seconds when retry
    $> lib_travis run "description" "command -some -options" --retry=3 --sleep=30


- run a command passed as a list of arguments

.. code-block:: bash

    # You need to pass '--' after the options for lib_travis run_x command,
    # then all following strings are considered as arguments to run a command,
    # and are not parsed as options for the run_x command itself.
    # that means, all options need to be stated before the '--' marker.
    # commands are splitted again with shlex - in case there are multiple commands in an argument
    $> lib_travis run_x --retry=3 --sleep=30 -- "description" command -some -options

    # in that case "echo test" will be splitted into ['echo', 'test']
    $> EXAMPLE="echo test"
    $> lib_travis run_x --retry=3 --sleep=30 -- ${EXAMPLE}


- get the branch to work on from travis environment variables

.. code-block:: bash

    $> BRANCH=$(lib_travis get_branch)

python methods:

.. code-block:: python

    def get_branch() -> str:
        """

        TRAVIS_BRANCH:
            for push builds, or builds not triggered by a pull request, this is the name of the branch.
            for builds triggered by a pull request this is the name of the branch targeted by the pull request.
            for builds triggered by a tag, this is the same as the name of the tag (TRAVIS_TAG).
            Note that for tags, git does not store the branch from which a commit was tagged. (so we use always master in that case)

        TRAVIS_PULL_REQUEST_BRANCH:
            if the current job is a pull request, the name of the branch from which the PR originated.
            if the current job is a push build, this variable is empty ("").

        TRAVIS_TAG:
            If the current build is for a git tag, this variable is set to the tagâ€™s name, otherwise it is empty ("").

Installation and Upgrade
------------------------

- Before You start, its highly recommended to update pip and setup tools:


.. code-block:: bash

    python -m pip --upgrade pip
    python -m pip --upgrade setuptools
    python -m pip --upgrade wheel

- to install the latest release from PyPi via pip (recommended):

.. code-block:: bash

    # install latest release from PyPi
    python -m pip install --upgrade lib_travis

    # test latest release from PyPi without installing (can be skipped)
    python -m pip install lib_travis --install-option test

- to install the latest development version from github via pip:


.. code-block:: bash

    # normal install
    python -m pip install --upgrade git+https://github.com/bitranox/lib_travis.git

    # to test without installing (can be skipped)
    python -m pip install git+https://github.com/bitranox/lib_travis.git --install-option test

    # to install and upgrade all dependencies regardless of version number
    python -m pip install --upgrade git+https://github.com/bitranox/lib_travis.git --upgrade-strategy eager


- include it into Your requirements.txt:

.. code-block:: bash

    # Insert following line in Your requirements.txt:
    # for the latest Release on pypi:
    lib_travis

    # for the latest development version :
    lib_travis @ git+https://github.com/bitranox/lib_travis.git

    # to install and upgrade all modules mentioned in requirements.txt:
    python -m pip install --upgrade -r /<path>/requirements.txt



- to install the latest development version from source code:

.. code-block:: bash

    # cd ~
    $ git clone https://github.com/bitranox/lib_travis.git
    $ cd lib_travis

    # to test without installing (can be skipped)
    python setup.py test

    # normal install
    python setup.py install

- via makefile:
  makefiles are a very convenient way to install. Here we can do much more,
  like installing virtual environments, clean caches and so on.

.. code-block:: shell

    # from Your shell's homedirectory:
    $ git clone https://github.com/bitranox/lib_travis.git
    $ cd lib_travis

    # to run the tests:
    $ make test

    # to install the package
    $ make install

    # to clean the package
    $ make clean

    # uninstall the package
    $ make uninstall
