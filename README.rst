Installation and Upgrade
------------------------

- Before You start, its highly recommended to update pip and setup tools:


.. code-block:: bash

    python -m pip --upgrade pip
    python -m pip --upgrade setuptools
    python -m pip --upgrade wheel

- to install the latest release from PyPi via pip (recommended):

.. code-block:: bash

    # install latest release from PyPi
    python -m pip install --upgrade lib_travis

    # test latest release from PyPi without installing (can be skipped)
    python -m pip install lib_travis --install-option test

- to install the latest development version from github via pip:


.. code-block:: bash

    # normal install
    python -m pip install --upgrade git+https://github.com/bitranox/lib_travis.git

    # to test without installing (can be skipped)
    python -m pip install git+https://github.com/bitranox/lib_travis.git --install-option test

    # to install and upgrade all dependencies regardless of version number
    python -m pip install --upgrade git+https://github.com/bitranox/lib_travis.git --upgrade-strategy eager


- include it into Your requirements.txt:

.. code-block:: bash

    # Insert following line in Your requirements.txt:
    # for the latest Release on pypi:
    lib_travis

    # for the latest development version :
    lib_travis @ git+https://github.com/bitranox/lib_travis.git

    # to install and upgrade all modules mentioned in requirements.txt:
    python -m pip install --upgrade -r /<path>/requirements.txt



- to install the latest development version from source code:

.. code-block:: bash

    # cd ~
    $ git clone https://github.com/bitranox/lib_travis.git
    $ cd lib_travis

    # to test without installing (can be skipped)
    python setup.py test

    # normal install
    python setup.py install

- via makefile:
  makefiles are a very convenient way to install. Here we can do much more,
  like installing virtual environments, clean caches and so on.

.. code-block:: shell

    # from Your shell's homedirectory:
    $ git clone https://github.com/bitranox/lib_travis.git
    $ cd lib_travis

    # to run the tests:
    $ make test

    # to install the package
    $ make install

    # to clean the package
    $ make clean

    # uninstall the package
    $ make uninstall
